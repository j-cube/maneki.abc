# maneki.abc The `maneki.abc` [Multiverse](http://multi-verse-io) Alembic 3D model.

The model is written using the Multiverse `Git` back-end, several important
iteration of its modeling design are included in the asset, see the commit
history of the model on the
[network](https://github.com/j-cube/maneki.abc/network)

**Maneki** is named after our mascot _“Maneki Neko” (招き猫)_, literally the
beckoning cat: with his welcoming pose and cuteness (かわいい) we invite you to
try our rendering technology at [http://maneki.sh](http://maneki.sh) which is
used for [BLAME!](http://www.blame.jp) movie adaptation.

If you'd like to say `"Hello, Maneki!"` you can find him chilling on → <span><a

## How to use 

1. First things first: check the LICENSE here below.
2. Download and install [Multiverse](http://multi-verse.io) for Maya / Houdini / Katana.
3. `git clone` the repository:

 > $ git clone https://github.com/j-cube/maneki.abc

4. Read the Alembic file into your DCC app using the Multiverse Read function.

 > NOTE: you really need to clone, and not use the GitHub "Download ZIP"
         function, since a Multiverse `.abc` file is a real repository.
         Alternatively, if you do not want to clone, you can download the
         "Milliways" version of `maneki.abc` from the
         [releases](https://github.com/j-cube/maneki.abc/releases) page of
         this GitHub project.
